# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Full Stack Nano - IAM Final Project

This is a full stack drink menu application. The application is able to:

1. Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2. Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3. Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4. Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.
